    <h1>I AM</h1>
    <h3>Sachin Ramesh Tendulker</h3>
    <h3>An Indian Former International cricketer</h3>
    <h1>hi</h1>
    <p>He is regarded as one of the greatest batsmen in the history of cricket.[4] He is the all-time highest run-scorer in both ODI and Test cricket with more than 18000 runs and 15000 runs respectively in total.[5] He also holds the record for receiving the most man-of-the-match awards in international cricket.[6] Known for his large fanbase and described by ESPNcricinfo as 'the most worshipped player in the world',[7] Tendulkar is sometimes referred to as "The God of Cricket" in India. A film with that name was released in 2021.[8]</p>
    <p>Tendulkar took up cricket at the age of eleven, made his Test match debut on 15 November 1989 against Pakistan in Karachi at the age of sixteen, and went on to represent Mumbai domestically and India internationally for close to twenty-four years. In 2002, halfway through his career, Wisden ranked him the second-greatest Test batsman of all time, behind Don Bradman, and the second-greatest ODI batsman of all time, behind Viv Richards.[9]</p>
    <p>Tendulkar received the Arjuna Award in 1994 for his outstanding sporting achievements, the Khel Ratna Award, India's highest sporting honour, in 1997, and the Padma Shri and Padma Vibhushan awards in 1999 and 2008, respectively, two of India's highest civilian awards.[11][12] A few hours after the end of his last match in November 2013, the Prime Minister's Office announced the decision to award him the Bharat Ratna, India's highest civilian award.</p>
